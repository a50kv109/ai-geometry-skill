## 2. Capability Boundaries & Gaps (CAPABILITY GAPs)

The following areas are explicitly **unsupported** by AI Geometry Skill v1.0.0:

1. **3D Solid Geometry (Stereometry)**:
   - *Status*: `CAPABILITY GAP / OUT OF SCOPE`
   - *Boundary*: The skill operates exclusively in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Spheres, polyhedra, and spatial cross-sections cannot be constructed.
2. **Arbitrary Angular Measurement (`ANGLE_VALUE`)**:
   - *Status*: `CAPABILITY GAP`
   - *Boundary*: The skill verifies orthogonal ($90^\circ$) and parallel ($0^\circ / 180^\circ$) relationships, but does not provide an arbitrary angular measurement predicate.
3. **Compound Polygon Entities (`POLYGON`)**:
   - *Status*: `CAPABILITY GAP`
   - *Boundary*: Geometry is represented via primitive points and segments. Compound n-gons (pentagons, trapezoids) exist only as sets of interconnected segments.
4. **Persistent Solution Branch Tree (`BranchTree`)**:
   - *Status*: `CAPABILITY GAP`
   - *Boundary*: `rootIndex` is a local order along a directed line vector. The system does not maintain global homotopy or branch tracking across arbitrary continuous transformations.
5. **Reactive Intersections**:
   - *Status*: `IMPLEMENTATION BEHAVIOR / GAP`
   - *Boundary*: Points produced via `intersect()` are static materialized snapshots. When parents move, these points do not dynamically recompute.
6. **Artifact Identity Timestamp Determinism**:
   - *Status*: `CAPABILITY GAP`
   - *Boundary*: While geometric payload in PGS-2D is 100% deterministic, `artifactId` uses `Date.now()`, preventing bit-identical envelope hashes.

## 3. Epistemic Visibility Boundaries (NOT REPRESENTABLE)

1. **Public `VANISHED` State**:
   - The internal knowledge graph tracks truth decay (`VERIFIED ➔ VANISHED ➔ VERIFIED`), but the public `verify()` method exports only a boolean status (`verified: false`).
   - The discrete epistemic status `VANISHED` is **`NOT REPRESENTABLE THROUGH CURRENT PUBLIC SKILL API`**.
